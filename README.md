# RKF45
This program performs the following tasks: 
1. Uses scipy's library function called solve_ivp with the RK45 algorithm.
2. Implements the RKF45 algorithm (not from the library).
3. Compares the results of the two algorithms.

Dependencies:
- math
- numpy
- matplotlib.pyplot
- scipy.integrate.solve_ivp
- plotly.graph_objects
- json

Usage:
- Ensure all dependencies are installed.
- Run the script.
